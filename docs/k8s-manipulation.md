Docs for accessing cluster API: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/access-cluster-api/
kubernetes.default.svc
PHP k8s client library: https://github.com/maclof/kubernetes-client

This can be used to:
 - Create ingresses for custom domains with HTTPS.
 - Run mediawiki maintenance script from API?
  - Update?
  - Dump?
 - Perform and backups not already done by other things?

Maybe all of this should be done in an operator?...

Notes in my book on this...
